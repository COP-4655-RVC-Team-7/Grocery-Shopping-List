### Overview
- Design an app that will allow the user to create a grocery list when shopping for their desired items.

### Description
- Users will be able to create a shopping list of any foods they want to shop for. They will be able to add or remove as many items as they please. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health 
- **Mobile:** Considering that customers are likely to keep their phones on them while shopping at stores, this app would be designed for mobile iOS devices.
- **Story:** To enhance the user's shopping experience, customers can create a list to find and purchase items more efficiently without the hassle of remembering what they need to buy.
- **Market:** Any person who frequently visits stores will benefit from this app.
- **Habit:** This app will most likely be used while shopping in stores.
- **Scope:** Our app will initially start as a simple app to help individuals plan their trips to the grocery stores by making their grocery lists. A product directory will be implemented in the future so that customers can see all of the available products in the store.
